## Example Usage
### Making a EngUnit
```rust
let temp_1 = temperature!(1.0, TemperatureDeltaUnit::K);
let mass_1 = mass!(1.0, MassUnit::Pound);
let t_1 = time!(1.0, TimeUnit::Minute);
let unit = temp_1 * mass_1 / t_1 * 123.45;
assert_eq!(123.45, unit.value);
assert_eq!("123.45 lbÂ·K/min", unit.to_string());
```
